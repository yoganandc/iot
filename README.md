## A Distributed Approach to Traffic Management

This project serves as a demonstration for how distance vector algorithms could be used in road networks 
to manage traffic in a distributed fault-tolerant manner.

Nodes at every intersection are equipped with wireless radios that can communicate with nodes at adjacent
intersections and vehicles approaching the intersection. By estimating traffic outgoing in each direction
and exchanging information with other nodes, optimal paths are discovered for all destinations.
